          <h1>The Hive: Terms of Participation</h1>

        </header>

        <div className="terms-content">
          <p>Welcome to The Hive. This document outlines our shared understanding of participation in this collective ecosystem. These are not just rules, but the foundational protocols for our "living covenant." By creating an account or otherwise participating in The Hive ecosystem ("the Platform"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Participation ("Terms").</p>
          
          <p>This agreement is between you ("you," "the Node") and The Hive collective, stewarded by the Guardians and its future foundational entity ("The Hive," "we," "us").</p>

          <h2>1. The Spirit of Our Agreement: A Collective Covenant</h2>
          <p>The Hive is not a traditional service or application. It is a shared infrastructure designed to facilitate coordination, communication, and convergence for the wellbeing of all. Your participation is a conscious act of co-creation. You are both a part of the whole and the whole itself. These Terms are designed to protect the integrity of our shared mission and the sovereignty of every Node within the ecosystem. By joining, you commit to participating in the spirit of building Horizon 3: a balanced, harmonious world where all can flourish.</p>

          <h2>2. Your Role and Responsibilities as a Node (Code of Conduct)</h2>
          <p>As a Node in this ecosystem, your actions ripple outwards. You agree to participate constructively and in good faith. By using the Platform, you commit to the following:</p>
          
          <h3>Cultivate Harmony</h3>
          <p>You will engage in respectful and constructive dialogue. You agree not to engage in harassment, hate speech, threats, intimidation, or discrimination of any kind. We are building a system that honors diversity in all its forms, including but not limited to race, gender, neurotype, culture, and belief.</p>
          
          <h3>Honor Sovereignty</h3>
          <p>You will respect the privacy, data, and autonomy of other Nodes. You will not attempt to access another Node's account or information without their explicit permission.</p>
          
          <h3>Contribute with Integrity</h3>
          <p>You will not misrepresent your identity, skills, or intentions. You will not upload malicious software, spam the network, or use the Platform for illegal activities.</p>
          
          <h3>Uphold Distributed Power</h3>
          <p>You agree not to use the Platform to hoard resources, concentrate power, or exploit other members for personal or commercial gain in a manner that undermines the collective wellbeing. The Hive is designed for generation, not extraction.</p>
          
          <h3>Engage in Good Faith</h3>
          <p>You will participate in coordination experiments and community dialogues with an authentic desire to contribute to the collective mission.</p>

          <h2>3. Your Rights and Sovereignty</h2>
          <p>Your participation is a contribution, not a surrender of your rights. The Hive is designed to empower you.</p>
          
          <h3>Ownership of Your Contributions</h3>
          <p>You retain full ownership of the intellectual property rights in the content you create and share on The Hive (your "Contributions"), such as your writings, designs, and ideas.</p>
          
          <h3>License to the Collective</h3>
          <p>To operate the Platform and fulfill our mission, you grant The Hive a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, transferable license to use, reproduce, display, and distribute your Contributions within the ecosystem. For example, this allows us to show your profile to other Nodes or feature your ideas in a community forum. This license is for the sole purpose of operating, developing, and promoting the collective project. It ends when you or The Hive terminate your account, though anonymized insights may be retained as described in our Privacy Covenant.</p>
          
          <h3>Right to Participate in Governance</h3>
          <p>As the ecosystem evolves, Nodes will be invited to participate in decisions that shape the Platform's future, in line with our principles of distributed leadership.</p>
          
          <h3>Right to Leave</h3>
          <p>You are free to leave The Hive at any time. Upon termination of your account, you have the right to export your personal data and Contributions, as detailed in our Privacy Covenant.</p>

          <h2>4. The Role and Limits of The Hive Ecosystem</h2>
          <h3>An Evolving, Experimental Platform</h3>
          <p>You acknowledge that The Hive is currently in Phase 1 (F1), a period of building and experimentation. The Platform is provided on an "as-is" and "as-available" basis. We do not offer warranties of any kind and cannot guarantee that the Platform will always be perfect, secure, or available. We are building this together.</p>
          
          <h3>Limitation of Liability</h3>
          <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, The Hive and its Guardians shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (a) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Platform; (b) any conduct or content of any third party on the Platform; or (c) unauthorized access, use, or alteration of your transmissions or content. The Hive is an infrastructure for connection; we are not responsible for the interactions between Nodes.</p>

          <h2>5. Conflict Transformation and Account Termination</h2>
          <p>Our goal is to resolve conflict constructively, not to punish.</p>
          
          <h3>Community-Led Resolution</h3>
          <p>Most disagreements should be handled through direct, good-faith dialogue between Nodes.</p>
          
          <h3>Guardian-Facilitated Mediation</h3>
          <p>If a conflict cannot be resolved or a Node is acting in violation of these Terms, the matter may be brought to The Hive's Guardians. The Guardians will facilitate a transparent process aimed at understanding and resolution, not retribution.</p>
          
          <h3>Suspension and Termination</h3>
          <p>Terminating a Node's participation is a last resort, reserved for serious and repeated violations that threaten the health, safety, and integrity of the ecosystem. Such actions include persistent harassment, malicious technical attacks, or clear attempts to exploit the system in violation of its core principles. The decision-making process will be fair and transparent, and the Node in question will be given an opportunity to be heard whenever possible. The Hive reserves the right to suspend or terminate your account if it is determined that your actions pose a fundamental risk to the collective.</p>

          <h2>6. General Provisions</h2>
          <h3>Changes to These Terms</h3>
          <p>This is a living covenant that will evolve with the ecosystem. We will provide notice of any significant changes. Your continued participation after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms. We will strive to include the community in the evolution of this agreement.</p>
          
          <h3>Governing Law</h3>
          <p>These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the jurisdiction where The Hive Foundation (or its equivalent legal entity) is registered, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
          
          <h3>Dispute Resolution</h3>
          <p>We are committed to resolving disputes internally through our Conflict Transformation process. Before resorting to formal legal action, you agree to first contact The Hive's Guardians to seek a resolution.</p>

          <h2>7. Contact</h2>
          <p>For any questions about these Terms, please contact The Hive's Guardians.</p>
